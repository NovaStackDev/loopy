Loopy

Loopy was my very first programming project — this repository is a re-archive of that early creation.

Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a playful, permanent pop-up — purely for fun and with no malicious intent.

Use at your own risk (LOL).

Setup

Clone this repository to a virtual machine.

Run the program carefully.

⚠️ I do not condone the modification of this project in any way.
